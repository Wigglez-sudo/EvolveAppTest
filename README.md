# 💪 Evolve

### Train smarter · Become next.

**A private, offline-first gym & nutrition tracker that lives entirely on your device.**

`Version 1.0` · Built by **Wigglez**

## 🔐 Test build hardening

This rebuild includes a **security-hardening test pass** over the app shell.

- Added a **Content Security Policy** and a `no-referrer` policy to the runtime page.
- Tightened **backup/import/restore validation** so malformed or hand-edited payloads can be rejected instead of being merged blindly.
- Added a **session-only AI Coach key** option (safer) alongside device storage.
- Tightened **service-worker caching** so only the app shell and Google Fonts are cached.
- Hardened **food-pack manifest and pack validation** before anything is stored on-device.

Because this is a test build, it is intentionally stricter than the 1.0 release. Some broken or hand-edited backup codes that used to import may now be rejected on purpose.

## 🌟 What is Evolve?

Evolve is a personal **fitness Progressive Web App (PWA)** — a full gym and nutrition tracker that runs in your browser and installs to your home screen like a native app. No accounts, no sign-ups, no ads, no servers. Everything you log stays **on your device**.

It's built for people who want a powerful training and food log *without* handing their data to a company.

## ✨ Features

### 🏋️ Train
- **Target a muscle group** — tap Chest, Back, Shoulders, Arms, Legs or Core to auto-build a workout; choose how many exercises, focus a sub-muscle, and swap any you don't like.
- **📋 Programs (routines)** — save a multi-day plan like **Push / Pull / Legs**, then start any day with one tap. Begin from a ready-made template (PPL, Upper/Lower, Full Body ×3) or build your own.
- **Mega workouts** — mix several muscle groups (plus optional cardio) into one session.
- **★ Favourites** — star exercises and build a session from them.
- **💾 Saved workouts** — save any session (or a Coach-generated one) and reuse it any time from a dedicated section in Train.
- **Gym / Home modes** — the exercise pool adapts to where you're training.
- **Live logging** — sets, reps, weights, supersets, rest timer, previous-set hints and quiet progressive-overload nudges.

### 🏃 Cardio
- Track any cardio activity with live calorie & distance estimates.
- **Ready, then Start** — a fresh cardio opens on a Ready screen and the timer only begins when you tap **▶ Start**, so you can get set up first.
- Pause, resume and finish — leave mid-session and it picks up where you left off.

### 🥩 Fuel (nutrition)
- **Plate-based logging** — add several foods to a running plate, then log the whole meal at once.
- **Floating ＋** — the Add Food button follows you as you scroll.
- **Smart portions** — common foods show a sensible portion (1 egg, 1 slice); everything else uses grams, and grams entry is always available.
- **Typo-friendly search** with your recent & favourite foods on top.
- **Your own foods** — add custom foods with macros and an optional category.
- Daily calorie ring and protein / carbs / fat / water targets.

### 📈 Progress
- **Trends** — bodyweight, lifting volume, and strength per exercise with **estimated 1RM** and a **60–95% training-percentage table** for percentage-based programming.
- **📸 Progress photos** — a private photo timeline stored **only on your device** (never uploaded, never backed up).
- **Activity calendar** — full workout, cardio and Mega history; expand any workout to repeat it.
- **Goals & milestones** — streaks, daily targets and achievements.

### 🤖 AI Coach *(optional)*
- A dedicated Coach tab powered by **your own** [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) API key (free models available).
- **Chat** about your training & nutrition, **generate a ready-to-use workout** (Start it now or Save for later), or **analyse your recent logs** — grounded in your actual data.
- 🔒 **Privacy-first:** this is the *only* feature that sends data off your device, and it tells you exactly what's shared before you enable it. Your API key is stored **only on this device**, is **never** included in any backup, and is never sent anywhere except OpenRouter.

### 🛒 Food packs *(optional)*
- Add big **UK supermarket food databases** from **Settings → Food packs** — Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Aldi.
- **Download only the shops you want.** Each pack's foods slot into the **normal categories** (Cheese, Dairy, Fast food & meals…) with the shop's name, and you can **filter your food search by shop**.
- Packs are stored **on your device** and work **offline** once downloaded.
- The data is built from [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org) by a scheduled GitHub Action and served from this repo. The app only **downloads** these public lists — it **never uploads** any of your data.

### ⚙️ Settings & personalisation
- **🎨 Themes** that recolour the whole app.
- **🔤 Heading font** — choose **Modern**, **Bold** or **Classic**.
- Units (kcal/kJ, kg/lb/stone), rest timer length + end beep & flash, keep-screen-awake, water unit, start tab, meal times and more.
- **Profile photo** — local only, never uploaded.

### 🔐 Backup & privacy
- **Encrypted backups** — lock your data with a password (AES-GCM via the Web Crypto API), then save or share the file anywhere you like (iCloud, Files, Drive, etc.). Restore with the same password.
- **Backup reminders** — Off / Daily / Weekly / Biweekly / Monthly, with optional notifications.
- **CSV export** — export your workouts or food log as a spreadsheet for your own records.
- **No tracking, no ads, no servers.** Photos and your AI key are device-only and never leave in a backup.

## 🔒 Privacy by design

Evolve is **offline-first** and stores everything in your browser's local storage on your own device.

- ✅ No account, no login, no email required
- ✅ No analytics, no tracking, no ads
- ✅ No backend server — there's nowhere for your data to be sent
- ✅ Backups are encrypted and only go where *you* choose to put them
- ⚠️ The **AI Coach** is the single optional exception — it sends your question and a training summary to OpenRouter *only when you ask it to*, and only after you've given clear consent

## Security hotfix test build 1.0.2

This test rebuild tightens plain backup-code restore so imported data is decoded through the same guarded parser used by encrypted restores. It strips dangerous object keys, enforces import size limits, and only merges known Evolve data keys before migration. Service-worker cache is bumped to evolve-v3-62.
